# whatsopen

A web tool that allows users to find businesses that are "open to all customers" or check if a business is so "open."
The php files draw on css which mostly comes from bootstrap. That is not included here but is available elsewhere.
Similarly, the site depends on some functions from the socrata php library available on GitHub.
